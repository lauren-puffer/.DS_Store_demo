# Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

```

# Create some dummy data

```{r}
data_demo <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = letters[1:5])
```

# Write csv of data file

```{r}
write.csv(data_demo, here("data_demo", "data_demo.csv"), row.names = FALSE)
```

I don't really know how adding files to .gitignore works since I've done that but I am still seeing them on GitHub. Will likely ask Carmen about this later on.
